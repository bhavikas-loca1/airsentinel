"""
Vehicle Emission Load Index — deterministic formula, matching the AirSentinel design plan
exactly (slide 4):

    vehicle count (by type & fuel, per RTO)
    x emission factor (g/km, ARAI/CPCB tables)
    x avg. distance (published transport surveys)
    = Vehicle Emission Load Index per zone

This is arithmetic over real inputs, not a fitted model — there is no training data, no
parameters estimated from data, and therefore no overfitting risk by construction. The only
"tuning" is the (documented, not hidden) choice of how to combine per-category loads into
one per-zone number, which is a sum followed by a relative (0-1) normalization — exactly
what the design plan's dashboard mockup shows ("Vehicle Emission Load Index: 0.81").

Honesty flag (carried verbatim from the design plan, slide 9): this is a modelled estimate
from registration data, not a live sensor reading — a legitimate, standard methodology (the
same one national emission inventories use), but not the same claim as "we measured a
tailpipe."
